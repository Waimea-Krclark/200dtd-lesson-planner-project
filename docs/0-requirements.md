# Project Requirements

## Identified Problem or Need

Managing lessons can get complicated for teachers because there are a lot of planning that goes into them. Keeping track of what lessons are happening when and what those lessons teach could get hard to keep track of, especially with resources and other things that are needed for the lessons.


## End-User Requirements

The primary user of my project would be teachers, though students could also find some use out of it as well. Due to there being a wide range of users the project should be easy to navigate and intuitive to use for people over a wide range of technical skill levels.

Users will require a way to manage lessons, keep track of times for these lessons, as well and manage what happens in the lessons (Notes, resources ect.)
Having easy way to control these things are important so that users can easily manage lessons efficiently and plan ahead.


## Proposed Solution

A lesson planner, where each week can be set up with with lessons for each day from Monday to Friday. Lessons can have notes and resources attached to it to allow users to plan for the lesson and easily be able to access relevant information per lesson. The project should have these features:

- A view of the week and lessons in each day
- List of lessons per day, management of daily lessons
- Accessing and managing resources for lessons
- See details of lessons, notes, resources ect
- Adding and removing lessons

# Relevant Implications

## Useability

The Useability implication relates to the ease of use of the outcome (in this case a website), meaning it should be easy for our end user to use without help.

### Relevance to the System

Because users of this project are likely to have a wide variety of technical skills, and making sure that my project works efficiently and is easy to use will mean that any user can operate the website without needing help.

### Impact / Considerations

To follow this implication I will need to make sure my project follows the common useability heuristics, being Visibility of system status, Match between system and the real world, User control and freedom, Consistency and standards, Error prevention, Recognition rather than recall, Flexibility and efficiency of use, Aesthetic and minimalist design, Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors, Help and documentation. This should mean any user can easily navigate and use the outcome without needing aid.



## End-User

End user implications are that the outcome suits the needs of the End-User and satisfies their requirements of the outcome.

### Relevance to the System

The end-users of my project will be teachers, so the project will need to provide a solution that will be useful for teachers to manage lessons. It should work both on computers and mobile devices so that users can access it whenever and wherever they need to.

### Impact / Considerations

For this implication I will need to design my project in a way that is useful for teachers, and can be used by teachers on the devices they would use, like laptops, mobile phones and desktops. It needs to also fulfil the uses it would be applied to, so lessons should be able to have notes and resources attached to allow teachers to plan ahead.



## Functionality

Functionality Implications refer to how well the website functions, both for its intended purpose and for the users. 

### Relevance to the System

My project will need to function well, and poor programming and bugs could stop it from working how it should. If it didn't function well for users and work for its intended purpose of a lesson planner, it would not be useful. 

### Impact / Considerations

Design the website to ensure that it meets the needs that it is made for. Bugfix as the bugs are discovered to make sure that the site functions well. Test with my end user to make sure that it works in the way that it should to fulfill the requirements. It will also need to handle bad user inputs incase a mistake is made, it should be able to be fixed without breaking the site.



## Aesthetic

Aesthetic Implications are about the design and style of the site, as well as its appeal to the end user.

### Relevance to the System

The website needs to be designed in a clear, easy to understand way to suit users with a wide range of technical skills. If it was styled poorly it could be more confusing to use or take away from the user experience.

### Impact / Considerations

Colours and layout should suit the context of a lesson planner to work well. The website should be designed in a clear, uncluttered way to clearly communicate the website's functions. Layout in a way where linked things are grouped and use good fonts and colour choices to make understandable for users.



## Accessibility

Accessibility Implications involve making sure that the outcome works and is useable by any end-user, regardless of their abilities.

### Relevance to the System

The end-users of this project are teachers, and students also could find this project useful, so their will be a wide range of users, each with different technical skills, and also some could have disabilities like colour blindness that could make using websites a challenge.

### Impact / Considerations

I will need to design my project in a way to make it more useable for anyone, making the lesson planner easy to use, with clear navigation will help users with little skill with computers, and also using colours, fonts and layouts that are readable and contrast well helping users with issues with their vision. Adding alt text to elements like images.
