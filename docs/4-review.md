## Addressing Relevant Implications

### USEABILITY IMPLICATION

To address the useability heuristic, I did a number of things to ensure that the outcome could be used by a wide variety of users with different technical skills. During the planning and development of the site, I made sure to keep things consistent so users will not get lost. For example, throughout the entire project, I had a simple and clear navigation menu that remains consistent throughout all pages, meaning that users wont get lost, and can navigate my web app. The site was designed in a way to clearly show to users what is happening, and what their options are, stopping them from getting stuck or not being able to achieve there goal with using the site. I followed useability heuristics to ensure that the site would be functioning at its best and be clear and useable for all users. For the Heuristics based around error prevention and error recovery, I made sure that the site handled user inputs correctly, stoping them from inputting invalid data into forms which would lead to errors and issues with the lesson planner not working, and error checks were performed before they happened, stopping them by giving users options to solve them or by the system dealing with it by itself, a good example being resource conflicts when deleting lessons. By following Heuristics, and ensuring that I design the site around the end-user's needs and capabilities, I have created a lesson planner that implements useability to benefit its end-users.


### END-USER IMPLICATION

As my end-users are teachers, my Lesson Planner needed to be designed to suit their needs, so that the site would actually be useful to them. When prototyping and planning my website, I added features that a teacher would find useful, such as being able to add resources to lessons, as  well as lesson/resource descriptions or notes.
